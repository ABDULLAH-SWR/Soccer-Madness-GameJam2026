# ⚽ Soccer Madness (Game Jam Submission)

**Event:** BUET CSE FEST 2026 Game Jam  
**Theme:** Equivalent Exchange  
**Engine:** Unity 6 (2D)  
**Platform:** Windows (PC)

## 📖 About The Game
**Soccer Madness** is a fast-paced arcade soccer game with a dark twist. We interpreted the theme **"Equivalent Exchange"** literally: **To gain something, you must lose something of equal value.**

In this game, your players are your ammo. Every time you score a goal, the universe demands a sacrifice, and one of your teammates explodes. You start with 5 players and need 5 goals to win. 

**The Catch:** If you waste your players on Own Goals, or if you run out of players *before* scoring the winning goal, you lose immediately.

## 🎮 Controls (Local Multiplayer)

| Action | **Player 1 ** | **Player 2 ** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Move** | `W` `A` `S` `D` | `Arrow Keys` |
| **Shoot / Kick** | `Spacebar` | `Right Ctrl` |
| **Pause** | `Esc` | `Esc` |

## 🏆 Rules & Mechanics
1.  **Objective:** Be the first to score **5 GOALS**.
2.  **The Curse:** Scoring a goal kills one random teammate.
3.  **The Twist:** An OWN GOAL counts for the opponent! They get the point, so the curse demands their sacrifice. (You give them a point, but kill their player.)
4.  **Game Over:** If your player count hits 0 before you reach 5 goals, **YOU LOSE**.
